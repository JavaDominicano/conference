    "abstract": "Most of us have heard the seven most expensive words in business: 'We've always done it this way.' We can see the resistance to change, and you can be certain that the solution you offer is necessary, but how can we become change agents using technology? Is it possible to achieve it?",
    "description": "Welcome to the end of the 'We've always done it this way' era. Lessons learned in software implementation... Today, I want to talk to you about change management in software implementations. In recent years, we have witnessed an explosion of technologies that have transformed the way we work and collaborate. However, implementing new software is not just a technical matter; it also involves cultural and organizational change that can be challenging to handle.In this talk, I will provide you with the keys to becoming an effective change agent using technology as a bridge.You will discover why change management is crucial in software implementations, what skills and tools you need to lead successful change, and how you can positively influence change from any position.",

Reinventing the wheel is a common pattern that DevOps engineers do when integrating security solutions inside their applications (authentication, password validation, identity management, correct storage of user data, etc.). Keycloak is an open-source identity management solution that focuses on offloading this burden from DevOps engineers, allowing them to focus on the business aspects of their applications and simplifying their solutions in the long run.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the benefits of using such a service with an enterprise application, with a live demonstration of a small application that uses the Eclipse MicroProfile APIs to correctly integrate it with Keycloak by way of the OpenIDConnect standards.",
